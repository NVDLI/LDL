We then retrieve the inputs and targets as NumPy arrays by calling the get() method. We explicitly split them up into a training set and a test set using the scikit-learn function train_test_split().\n",

That is, the standardized value of the total number of bedrooms is not affected by the values of the population or any of the other variables.\n"
