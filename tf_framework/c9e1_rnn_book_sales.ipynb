    "To shed some light on how this affects the end behavior, let us use our newly trained model to do some predictions and then plot these predictions next to the actual values. The code snippet below demonstrates how this can be done. We first call model.predict with the test input as argument. The second argument is the batch size, and we state the length of the input tensor as the batch size (i.e., we ask it to do a prediction for all the input examples in parallel). During training, the batch size will affect the result, but for prediction, it should not affect anything except for possibly runtime. We could just as well have used 16 or 32 or some other value. The model will return a 2D array with the output values. Because each output value is a single value, a 1D array works just as well, and that is the format we want in order to enable plotting the data, so we call np.reshape to change the dimensions of the array. The network works with standardized data, so the output will not represent demand directly. We must first destandardize the data by doing the reverse operation compared to the standardization. That is, we multiply by the standard deviation and add the mean. We then plot the data."
