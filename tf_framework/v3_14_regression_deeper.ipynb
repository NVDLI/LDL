    "This code example is very similar to v3_14_regression but the network is modified to use more layers with more neurons as well as dropout regularization. ore context for this code example can be found in video 3.14 \"Programming Example: Regression Problem with TensorFlow\" in the video series \"Learning Deep Learning: From Perceptron to Large Language Models\" by Magnus Ekman (Video ISBN-13: 9780138177614).
