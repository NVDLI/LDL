We specify a vocabulary size of 10,000 symbols, out of which four indices are reserved for padding, out-of-vocabulary words (denoted as UNK), START tokens, and STOP tokens. Our training corpus is large, so we set the parameter READ_LINES to the number of lines in the input file we want to use in our example (60,000). The parameter LAYER_SIZE defines the width of the intermediate fully-connected layer in the Transformer, and the embedding layers output 128 dimensions (EMBEDDING_WIDTH). We use 20% (TEST_PERCENT) of the dataset as test set and further select 20 sentences (SAMPLE_SIZE) to inspect in detail during training. We limit the length of the source and destination sentences to, at most, 60 words (MAX_LENGTH).

We have assumed that the longest source sentence is six words, so we padded src_input to be of that length. Similarly, we have assumed that the longest destination sentence is eight words including START and STOP tokens, so we padded both dest_input and dest_target to be of that length. Note how the symbols in dest_input are offset by one location compared to the symbols in dest_target because when we later do inference, the inputs into the decoder network will be coming from the output of the network for the previous timestep. Although this example has shown the training example as being lists, in reality, they will be rows in NumPy arrays, where each array contains multiple training examples.\n",

It is easy to miss that dest_input_token_seq has a STOP_INDEX, but that falls out naturally because it is created from the dest_target_token_seq for which a STOP_INDEX was just added to each sentence.\n",

The pad_sequences() function pads the sequences with the PAD value and then returns a NumPy array. The default behavior of pad_sequences is to do prepadding, and we do that for the source sequence but explicitly ask for postpadding for the destination sequences.\n",

    "You might wonder why there is no call to to_categorical() in the statement that creates the target (output) data. We are used to wanting to have the ground truth one-hot encoded for textual data. Not doing so is an optimization to avoid wasting too much memory. With a vocabulary of 10,000 words, and 60,000 training examples, where each training example is a sentence, the memory footprint of the one-hot encoded data starts becoming a problem. Therefore, instead of one-hot encoding all data up front, there is a way to let Keras deal with that in the loss function itself.\n"

However, in this case, we want some more control ourselves because we will want to inspect a few select members of the test set in detail. We split the dataset by first creating a list test_indices, which contains a 20% (TEST_PERCENT) subset of all the numbers from 0 to N−1, where N is the size of our original dataset. We then create a list train_indices, which contains the remaining 80%. We can now use these lists to select a number of rows in the matrices representing the dataset and create two new collections of matrices, one to be used as training set and one to be used as test set. Finally, we create a third collection of matrices, which only contains 20 (SAMPLE_SIZE) random examples from the test dataset.

We then set the input x to the START token and use the decoder to make a prediction. We retrieve the most probable word and append it to x. We then provide this sequence to the decoder and make a new prediction. We iterate this with a gradually growing input sequence in an autoregressive manner until the model produces a STOP token or until a given number of words have been produced. Finally, we convert the produced tokenized sequences into the corresponding word sequences and print them out.\n"
