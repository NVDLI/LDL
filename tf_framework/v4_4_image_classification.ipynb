    "The actual model is created by the next code snippet, which first declares a Sequential model and then adds layers. We are now working with a 2D convolutional layer, so there is no need to start with a Flatten layer because the dimensions of the input image already match the required dimension of the first layer. We tell the layer that the input shape of the image is 32×32×3. We also state that we want 64 channels, a kernel size of 5×5, a stride of (2, 2), and padding=’same’. We specify the neuron type as ReLU because that has been shown to be a good activation function. The combination of padding=’same’ and strides=(2,2) results in half as many neurons in each dimension as in the previous layer (i.e., 16×16 neurons per channel because the input image has 32×32 pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next convolutional layer is similar but with a smaller kernel size. There is no need to specify the input shape—it is implicitly defined by the outputs of the previous layer. The number of neurons per channel is implicitly defined as 8×8 because the previous layer was 16×16 outputs per channel, and we choose a stride of 2, 2 for this layer as well.\n",

    "Before we can add the fully connected (Dense) layer, we need to flatten (convert from three dimensions to a single dimension) the outputs from the second convolutional layer.
