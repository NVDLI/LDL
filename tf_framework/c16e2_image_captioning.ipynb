    "As previously mentioned, we cannot afford to keep the entire dataset in memory during training but need to create our training batches on the fly. We handle this task by creating a class that inherits from the Keras PyDataset class in the code snippet below (in previous versions of Keras this class was kalled Sequence). In the constructor, we supply the paths to the feature vectors, as well as the tokenized captions, and the batch size. Just as for the language translation example, the recurrent network in the decoder will need the tokenized data both as input and output but shifted by one location and with a START token on the input side. This explains why we provide two variables dest_input_data and dest_target_data to the constructor. We also need to provide the batch size.\n",

The output format of this method depends on what our network requires as input. For a single training example, our network needs a set of feature vectors as input from the encoder side and a shifted version of the target sentence as input to the decoder recurrent network. It also needs the original version of the target sentence as the desired output for the network. Thus, the output from this method should be a list with two elements representing the two inputs and a single element representing the output. The details become clearer when we later build our training network. There is one more thing to consider, though. The __getitem__() method is expected to return a batch instead of a single training example, so each of the three items we described will be an array where the number of elements is determined by the batch size.\n"
