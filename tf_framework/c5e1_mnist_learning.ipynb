In our case, the inputs are changed from a 28×28 array into an array of 784 elements. The second and third layers are both Dense layers, which means they are fully connected. The first argument tells how many neurons each layer should have, and the activation argument tells the type of activation function; we choose tanh and sigmoid, where sigmoid means the logistic sigmoid function. We pass our initializer object to initialize the regular weights using the kernel_initializer argument. The bias weights are initialized to 0 using the bias_initializer argument.\n"

This means that we want to use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when training the network. We then prepare the model for training by calling the model’s compile function. We provide parameters to specify which loss function to use, the optimizer that we just created and that we are interested in looking at the accuracy metric during training. Note that although this example uses mean squared error (MSE) as loss function, in general that is not a good choice in combination with sigmoid output neurons. We change this in subsequent programming examples.\n",

Our variables EPOCHS and BATCH_SIZE from the initialization code determine how many epochs to train for and what batch size we use. We had set BATCH_SIZE to 1, which means that we update the weight after a single training example. We set verbose=2 to get a reasonable amount of information printed during the training process and set shuffle to True to indicate that we want the order of the training data to be randomized during the training process.\n"
