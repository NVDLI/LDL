    "This code example extends the multimodal network from c17e2_multi_modal with an additional head to build a network that does multitask learning using multimodal inputs. We teach the network to simultaneously do multiclass classification (identify the handwritten digit) and perform a simple question-answering task. The question-answering task is to provide a yes/no answer to a question about the digit in the image. The textual input will look similar to the textual input in c17e2_multi_modal ('upper half', 'lower half', 'odd number', 'even number'). However, instead of correctly describing the digit, the text is chosen randomly and represents a question. The network is then tasked with classifying the image into one of ten classes as well as with determining whether the answer to the question is yes or no (is the statement true or false). More context for this code example can be found in the section \"Programming Example: Multiclass classification and question answering with a single network\" in Chapter 17 in the book Learning Deep Learning by Magnus Ekman (ISBN: 9780137470358).\n",

    "The next code snippet creates the network. Most of the network is identical to the programming example for the multimodal network. The key difference is that in parallel with the ten-unit output layer for multiclass classification, there is a one-unit output layer for binary classification. Given that there are two separate outputs, we also need to supply two separate loss functions. In addition, we supply weights for these two loss functions to indicate how to weigh the two into a single loss function for training the network. The weights should be treated like any other hyperparameter. A reasonable starting point is to have the same weight for both losses, so we use 50/50. Finally, when calling the fit method, we must provide ground truth for both heads of the model.\n"
