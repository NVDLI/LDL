    "This code example extends the multimodal network from c17e2_multi_modal with an additional head to build a network that does multitask learning using multimodal inputs. We teach the network to simultaneously do multiclass classification (identify the handwritten digit) and perform a simple question-answering task. The question-answering task is to provide a yes/no answer to a question about the digit in the image. The textual input will look similar to the textual input in c17e2_multi_modal ('upper half', 'lower half', 'odd number', 'even number'). However, instead of correctly describing the digit, the text is chosen randomly and represents a question. The network is then tasked with classifying the image into one of ten classes as well as with determining whether the answer to the question is yes or no (is the statement true or false). More context for this code example can be found in the section \"Programming Example: Multiclass classification and question answering with a single network\" in Chapter 17 in the book Learning Deep Learning by Magnus Ekman (ISBN: 9780137470358).\n",
