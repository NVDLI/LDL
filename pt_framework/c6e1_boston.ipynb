    "Unlike MNIST, the Boston Housing dataset is not included with PyTorch, so we retrieve it using scikit-learn instead. This is done by calling the load_boston() function. We then retrieve the inputs and targets as NumPy arrays by calling the get() method. We explicitly split them up into a training set and a test set using the scikit-learn function train_test_split().\n",

That is, the standardized value of the nitric oxides concentration is not affected by the values of the per capita crime rate or any of the other variables.\n",

The two hidden layers in our network implementation have 64 ReLU neurons each, where the first layer is declared to have 13 inputs to match the dataset. The output layer consists of a single neuron with a linear activation function. We use MSE as the loss function and use the Adam optimizer.\n",

In particular, it takes a parameter \"metric\". If we work on a classification problem it should be set to \"acc\" and the function will compute accuracy. If we work on a regression problem it should be set to \"mae\" and the function will compute mean absolute error instead. \n"
