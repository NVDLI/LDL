    "We are now ready to create the model, but we do this differently than we have done in previous examples, both to illustrate some new constructs but also to provide more flexibility in what we are building. Instead of instantiating a Sequential model with standard layers, we build a fully customized model. This is done by extending the nn.Module class. We already saw examples of that when we built custom layers, and we use a similar methodology when building a fully custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the details of this model we first need to take a detour and discuss some details of how we plan to use the model to do predictions. We do this a little bit differently than in the previous example. Instead of feeding a string of symbols as input to the model, we feed it only a single symbol at a time. This is an alternative implementation compared to the previous implementation, where we repeatedly fed the model a growing sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme used in this example has a subtle implication, which has to do with dependencies between multiple consecutive calls to the model. In the previous example we did not have an expectation that the inputs to the first prediction should impact the second prediction. In this example, we do want that to happen. We want the LSTM layers to retain their c and h states from one call to another so that the outputs of subsequent calls to the model will depend on the prior calls to the model. We provide this functionality with our own custom methods set_state(), get_state(), and clear_state().\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to describe the details of our model. The __init__() function will be called a single time when the model is created. When building a custom model, this is the place to put any initialization code, such as declaring the layers to be used by the model as well as any other variables that will be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with declaring two variables state and use_state to control how we handle initialization of the internal state of the LSTM layers (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model, we start with declaring an Embedding layer with MAX_WORDS as input size and EMBEDDING_WIDTH as output size. We adjust the weight initialization to use uniform random numbers between -0.05 and 0.05, as opposed to the default range of -1.0 to 1.0. We did this to match the range used in our TensorFlow examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we declare an LSTM module containing two LSTM layers. We also add a Dropout layer, followed by two fully connected layers, with ReLU activation in-between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the model is defined in the forward method. We feed the inputs to the embedding layer and the resulting outputs are temporarily stored in the variable x. Next we arrive at the custom state handling code for the LSTM layers. If our variable use_state is False (the value we initialized it to), we will call the LSTM layers with just x as input. This implies that the LSTM module will use 0 as initial h and c states. However, if use_state is set to true, we will also supply the variable self.state as input to the LSTM layers. In that case the LSTM layers will use these states as their initial states instead of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the LSTM layers has been called, we retrieve the resulting internal state and store it in self.state so it can be used as input for the next timestep. Apart from calling detach() we also call clone(), which makes a copy of the state so it does not change under the hood by the layers themselves if they are later called with new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then feed the output from the top LSTM layer through the Dropout layer. The indices after variable x results in selecting the final timestep for the top LSTM layer. That is, this is equivalent to the functionality of the custom layer in c11e1_autocomplete. Given that we are building a custom model and have explicit control of how the layers are connected, there is no need to declare a custom layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the forward method is straight forward and we feed the output from the Dropout layer through a Linear layer, followed by a ReLU layer, and finally another Linear layer that represents the Softmax layer but without its activation function, which is later included in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us detail the intended use of set_state, get_state, and clear_state. At the beginning of time the use_state variable is set to False. When calling the model, it will use 0 as internal state. After each call to the model, we can retrieve the resulting state by calling get_state. If we later want the model to use this state as its initial state, we simply call set_state and supply that state to the model, before we call the model with its input data. If we later decide that we want to start with a cleared internal state again, we simply call the clear_state method. This concludes the description of the custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we instantiate the model, select our normal optimizer and loss function, and finally train the model. Our training process does not make use of the just described state handling and the model will simply use 0 as initial state for each call to the model during training.\n"
