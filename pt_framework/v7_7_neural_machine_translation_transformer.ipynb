The parameter LAYER_SIZE defines the width of the intermediate fully-connected layer in the Transformer, and the embedding layers output 128 dimensions (EMBEDDING_WIDTH).

Similarly, we have assumed that the longest destination sentence is eight words including START and STOP tokens, so we padded both dest_input and dest_target to be of that length. Note how the symbols in dest_input are offset by one location compared to the symbols in dest_target because when we later do inference, the inputs into the decoder network will be coming from the output of the network for the previous timestep. Although this example has shown the training example as being lists, in reality, they will be rows in NumPy arrays, where each array contains multiple training examples.\n",

    "The final code snippet shows hos to train and test the model. It is very similar to the LSTM-based translation network. The key difference is the mask objects needed by the Transformer encoder and decoder modules. Both the encoder and decoder require a mask indicated, which input positions correspond to PAD tokens. Additionally, the decoder requires a mask to specify which positions it is allowed to self-attend to. This mask is created with the method generate_square_subsequent_mask(), which is provided by the Transformer class.\n",

We provide the source sentence to the encoder model to create the resulting internal state and store to the variable intermediate_states. We then set the input x to the START token and use the decoder to make a prediction. We retrieve the most probable word and append it to x. We then provide this sequence to the decoder and make a new prediction. We iterate this with a gradually growing input sequence in an autoregressive manner until the model produces a STOP token or until a given number of words have been produced. Finally, we convert the produced tokenized sequences into the corresponding word sequences and print them out.\n"
