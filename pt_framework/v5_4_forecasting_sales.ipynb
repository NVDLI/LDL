    "We are finally ready to define and train our network. This is shown in the code snippet below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet introduces a new type of construct. At the very top we create a custom layer by defining a class LastTimestep that extends the nn.Module class. Although we did not explicitly mention it, the layers that we have used in other examples (e.g., Linear, Conv2d, Flatten, and ReLU) were all subclasses of the nn.Module class. The only thing we need to do to create a custom layer based on nn.Module is to provide our own forward() method. This method will be called with the layer inputs as parameter when the layer is invoked. The method is expected to return the resulting output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explain why we need to implement this custom layer, we first need to describe some details of the nn.RNN class used to implement recurrent networks in PyTorch. The nn.RNN class is not simply a single recurrent layer, but it implements a stack of recurrent layers, where the number of layers is determined by the first parameter to the constructor. When an instance of nn.RNN is called, it returns a tuple with two elements. The first element in the tuple is a tensor that contains the output value of the top layer for each timestep. The second element in the tuple is a tensor that contains the final output value for each of the layers. Note that since the nn.RNN module will receive a full mini-batch as input, one of the dimensions for these tensors is used to specify which training/test example in a mini-batch to access. If the batch_first argument to the constructor is set to True, then index 0 in the tensor corresponds to the mini-batch index. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we want a single recurrent layer, and we want the final output value of this single layer to be fed to a fully connected (Linear) layer. This is why we build the custom layer. Its only task is to retrieve the right data value and drop the others on the floor. This is done by first selecting the second element in the tuple (index 1), which results in a tensor containing the final output value for each layer. From this tensor we now retrieve the value corresponding to the top layer (index 0 since our RNN will only have a single recurrent layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now create our full model by starting with an nn.RNN with a single layer and 128 units. The nn.RNN class does include the ability to select what activation function to use and we specify ReLU. The RNN module is followed by our custom layer that then feeds into a Linear layer with 128 inputs and a single output. The number of inputs (128) must match the number of outputs from the preceding layer.\n",
