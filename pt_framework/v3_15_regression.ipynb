    "Unlike MNIST, the California Housing dataset is not included with PyTorch, so we retrieve it using scikit-learn instead. This is done by calling the fetch_california_housing() function. We then retrieve the inputs and targets as NumPy arrays by calling the get() method. We explicitly split them up into a training set and a test set using the scikit-learn function train_test_split().\n",

The parameter axis=0 ensures that we compute the mean and standard deviation for each input variable separately.

That is, the standardized value of the total number of bedrooms is not affected by the values of the population or any of the other variables.\n",
