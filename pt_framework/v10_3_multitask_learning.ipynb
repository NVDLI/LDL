    "This code example extends the multimodal network from v9_3_multimodal_classification with an additional head to build a network that does multitask learning using multimodal inputs. We teach the network to simultaneously do multiclass classification (identify the handwritten digit) and perform a simple question-answering task. The question-answering task is to provide a yes/no answer to a question about the digit in the image. The textual input will look similar to the textual input in v9_3_multimodal_classification ('upper half', 'lower half', 'odd number', 'even number'). However, instead of correctly describing the digit, the text is chosen randomly and represents a question. The network is then tasked with classifying the image into one of ten classes as well as with determining whether the answer to the question is yes or no (is the statement true or false). More context for this code example can be found in video 10.3 \"Programming Example: Multitask Learning with PyTorch\" in the video series \"Learning Deep Learning: From Perceptron to Large Language Models\" by Magnus Ekman (Video ISBN-13: 9780138177614).\n",

We need to decide on weights for these two loss functions to indicate how to weigh the two into a single loss function for training the network. The weights should be treated like any other hyperparameter. A reasonable starting point is to have the same weight for both losses, so we use 50/50 in our implementation. You can see how we compute and weigh these two losses as a part of the forward pass in the code snippet below.
