    "This code example is very similar to v4_5_image_classification but the network is modified to use a more complex network. More context for this code example can be found in video 4.5 \"Programming Example: Image Classification Using CNN with PyTorch\" in the video series \"Learning Deep Learning: From Perceptron to Large Language Models\" by Magnus Ekman (Video ISBN-13: 9780138177614). This is notebook 3 of 3 for that example.\n"
