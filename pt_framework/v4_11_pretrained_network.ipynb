    "The final code snippet starts with loading the pretrained ResNet-50 model. We put the model in evaluation mode since we will use it for inference and not training. We then move the model and the input image to the GPU (if present).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then do a prediction by calling the model with the image as input. By doing the call to a model inside the scope of a torch.no_grad() statement, PyTorch is told that it does not need to track information needed to automatically be able to calculate gradients for the model during this call. This reduces the amount of computation needed and makes the code snippet run faster. In this case when we only do a single call to the model it is not that important, but it can make a difference when doing inference for a large number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have previously seen, when implementing a model in PyTorch, the activation function for the final SoftMax layer is omitted since it is included in the PyTorch implementation of the cross-entropy loss function. However, that is only the case when using a model for training. When using a model for inference, we therefore need to run the outputs through a softmax function to convert the logits (weighted sums) to probabilities. This is done with a call to torch.nn.functiona.softmax().\n",

    "We sort the resulting probabilities with a call to torch.sort() which returns both the sorted values and the indices of their locations in the vector. We are interested in the indices (each index corresponds to an image category). We then print out the indices of the top five image categories, as well as their corresponding probabilities. The calls to item() converts the values from the PyTorch tensor datatype to a standard Python datatype.\n",
